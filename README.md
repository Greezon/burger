# Burger App
I built an basic order app where I can add items and delete them. More importantly I deployed them to heroku and attached a database.

## This project was incredibly challanging at the start; however, after I got the first functions rolling it got easier and easier. The hardest part for me was learning how to save the score.

### HTML
	I purposly made the HTML styling bland, and simple, but effective and easy to read. I feel like I have good handle on how to make a database driven application.
